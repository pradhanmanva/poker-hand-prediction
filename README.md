1. Relevant Information:  
     Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing  
     cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described  
     using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive  
     attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the  
     Poker Hand. The order of cards is important, which is why there  
     are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 (one for each  
     suit  explained in more detail below).

5. Missing Attribute Values: None
6. Class Distribution:
        The first percentage in parenthesis is the representation within the training set. 
        The second is the probability in the full domain.
        a) Training set:
            0: Nothing in hand, 12493 instances (49.95202% / 50.117739%)  
            1: One pair, 10599 instances, (42.37905% / 42.256903%) 
            2: Two pairs, 1206 instances, (4.82207% / 4.753902%) 
            3: Three of a kind, 513 instances, (2.05118% / 2.112845%) 
            4: Straight, 93 instances, (0.37185% / 0.392465%) 
            5: Flush, 54 instances, (0.21591% / 0.19654%) 
            6: Full house, 36 instances, (0.14394% / 0.144058%) 
            7: Four of a kind, 6 instances, (0.02399% / 0.02401%) 
            8: Straight flush, 5 instances, (0.01999% / 0.001385%) 
            9: Royal flush, 5 instances, (0.01999% / 0.000154%)           
        The Straight flush and Royal flush hands are not as representative of the true domain because they have been over-sampled. 
        The Straight flush is 14.43 times more likely to occur in the training set, while the Royal flush is 129.82 times more likely.           Total of 25010 instances in a domain of 311,875,200.
        b) Testing set:
        The value inside parenthesis indicates the representation within the test set as compared to the entire domain. 
        1.0 would be perfect representation, while <1.0 are under-represented and >1.0 are over-represented.           
            0: Nothing in hand, 501209 instances,(1.000063)  
            1: One pair, 422498 instances,(0.999832) 
            2: Two pairs, 47622 instances, (1.001746) 
            3: Three of a kind, 21121 instances, (0.999647) 
            4: Straight, 3885 instances, (0.989897)

            6: Full house, 1424 instances, (0.988491) 
            7: Four of a kind, 230 instances, (0.957934) 
            8: Straight flush, 12 instances, (0.866426) 
            9: Royal flush, 3 instances, (1.948052) 
            Total of one million instances in a domain of 311,875,200.

### Procedure to run the program  
  
* Install spark in your machine and make sure spark-submit works fine. Found [this](https://isaacchanghau.github.io/post/install_spark_mac/) to be really useful resource to install spark in mac.  
* Open two terminal windows. Traverse to /src for running the driver program.  
* The driver program is src/main.py. Run the driver program in one of the terminals with the following command - spark-submit src/main.py <port_to_stream_data_from> <interval_for_streaming> <path_to_test_data>  
* On another terminal, run ./stream.sh <path_to_poker-data.txt> <port_to_stream_data_to> <interval_for_streaming> <batch_size> <ignore_header_flag[true or false]>  
  
Note: All commands assume that the current working directory is the project root. Port number and streaming interval should be the same in both the commands.
